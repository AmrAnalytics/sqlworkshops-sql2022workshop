# Demo for Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022 (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

The following are steps to demo Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022 to allow easy integration of SQL Server data with Azure Synapse Analytics. The steps in this demo enhance the exercise to configure Synapse Link from the documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/synapse-link/connect-synapse-link-sql-server-2022.

## Prereqs

- SQL Server 2022 Evaluation Edition
- An Azure subscription with permissions to create an Azure Synapse Workspace and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account (Synapse uses one and you need a separate one for a concept called a Landing Zone).
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The latest 18.x build or 19.x build will work.
